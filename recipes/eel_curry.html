        <li>200g white rice</li>
        <li>2 eel fillets (fresh preferred, keep the skin on)</li>
        <li>2.5 tbsps sugar</li>
        <li>4 tbsps mirin</li>
        <li>2.5 tbsps cooking sake</li>
        <li>260mL water</li>
        <li>4 tbsps soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong>Combine the cooking sake and mirin in a saucepan. Bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and add the sugar, stirring it in until completely dissolved. 
            Add soy sauce. Bring to the boil then simmer for 10 minutes, or until the sauce thickens. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the rice:</strong>While the sauce is cooking, prepare the rice using your preferred method. We recommend cooking 200g rice in 260mL water for the ideal texture and 
            consistency of fluffy, steamed white rice.</li>
        <li><strong>Grill the eel:</strong>Turn your barbecue/stove/other grilling unit up to high heat (250C). Get a baking tray, line with baking paper. Slice your fillets in half lengthwise 
            and widthwise. Wipe some vegetable oil onto them, place them on the baking tray, and grill for 5-7 minutes or until evenly browned. </li>
        <li><strong>Add the unagi sauce:</strong>Take the eel out of the grill, and brush the unagi sauce generously over the fillets (pour any remaining juice over the fillets to coat them). 
            Return to the grill for a minute to let the sauce thicken and bubble up, before removing the eel properly from the grill. </li>
        <li><strong>Serve the unagi eel:</strong>Serve the sauced eel on top of a bed of hot white rice. Enjoy in a bento box</li>
